The long short term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) are two popular architecture variants of recurrent neural Network (RNN). Both of these architecture were purposed to solve the long term dependency problem, which means the previous RNN architecture had hard time carrying information from earlier time steps to later ones. In this study, Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency, price is predicted using both LSTM and GRU to study the comparison using metrices such as training time, prediction error such as root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R$^2$) and prediction trend with directional accuracy (DA).
